Look at this stuff, isn't it neat
Alexis Pauline Gumbs
Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?
Tale as old as time
No one's slick as Gaston
When I was a lad I ate four dozen eggs
You ain't never had a friend like me
I can show you the world
Let's get down to business to defeat the Huns
When will my reflection show who I am inside
When will my reflection show who I am inside?
When somebody loved me
When somebody loved me, everything was beautiful
At last I see the light
And at last I see the light
All my life has been a series of doors
All my life has been a series of doors in my face
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
We could be immortals
I've been staring at the edge of the water
See the line where the sky meets the sea
